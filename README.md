# Game Finder Application

This project was used to demonstrate our understanding of sprints and the planning process associated with them.  Game Finder mimics a database of video games. 

 It contains three tables: Games, GameSystems, and Genres. The relationships between each of the tables are shown in the dbdiagram (linked below).

 Also linked below is the Google Doc containing our user stories and theoretical tickets which we thought would complete the given stories to produce an MVP.
